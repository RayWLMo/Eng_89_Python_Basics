# What are Data Types and Operators

# Boolean, Numbers and Strings

# Operators: Arithmetic Operators
# '-' is used to subtract one value from another
# '+' is used to add two (or more) values
# '*' is used to multiply two (or more) values
# '/' is used to divide one value from another
# '%' is used to give the remainder of a division (modulus)
# '**' is used to give the exponential value by another value

# Comparison Operators
# '>' - Greater than
# '<' - Less Than
# '==' - Equal to
# '!=' - Not equal to
# '>=' - Is greater than or equal to
# '<=' - Is less than or equal to

number_1 = 4
number_2 = 2

print(number_1 + number_2)  # prints the combined value of number_1 and number_2
print(number_1 - number_2)  # prints the value of number_1 minus number_2
print(number_1 * number_2)  # prints the product of number_1 and number_2
print(number_1 / number_2)  # prints the result of number_1 divided by number_2 as a float
print(number_1 % number_2)  # prints the remainder value of a division
print(number_1 ** number_2)  # prints the exponential value of number_1 by number_2

# Boolean Values

print("Boolean Values")
print(number_1 <= number_2)  # is number_1 less than or equal to number_2? Not True False
print(number_1 == number_2)  # is number_1 equals number_2? Not True/False
print(number_1 != number_2)  # is number_1 not equal to number_2? True
print(number_1 >= number_2)  # is number_1 greater than number_2? True
